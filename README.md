# Handwritten Digit Recognition
By recognizing the whole handwriting words, we first attempt to recognize single digit first.

We use [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database with various Machine Learning algorithms to solve the stated problem.

Algorithms that we used:

  * [K Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/dangne/damhtkll/tree/onedigit/KNN)
