# Handwritten Digit Recognition
By recognizing the whole handwriting words, we first attempt to recognize single digit first.

We use [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database with K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to solve the stated problem.

Please extract ubyte files before running the KNN algorithm
